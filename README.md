# knight

Knight is a web application that determines what cells a chess knight could take in X turns.
The client is written in Angular, and the back end with Python and Flask.

For the sake of simplicity, both the client and the server are in this repo, under different folders.
Both folders have README's of their own, in which the architecure is described.
